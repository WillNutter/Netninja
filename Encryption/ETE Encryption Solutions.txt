   - Create a new encrypted vault within your preferred cloud storage service (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive).

Some file managers for iOS support encrypted volumes. For instance:

   - Mount and share the VeraCrypt volume on your computer over a secure network.
   - Use FE File Explorer on your iPhone to connect to the shared volume. This allows you to access encrypted files directly over the network without decrypting them locally on your iPhone.

2. **Documents by Readdle:**
   - Similar to FE File Explorer, it can connect to network shares where your VeraCrypt volume is mounted on another device.
   - This allows for secure access to your encrypted files without them being decrypted on your iPhone.

### Summary

Using tools like Cryptomator or Boxcryptor ensures that your data stays encrypted at all times, even when accessing it on your iPhone. Both solutions provide strong encryption and seamless integration with popular cloud storage services, allowing you to access your encrypted files securely from your iPhone.
