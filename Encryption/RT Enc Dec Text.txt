Certainly! Here's a simple Python example demonstrating real-time encryption and decryption using the `cryptography` library:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a key
key = Fernet.generate_key()

# Create a Fernet cipher
cipher = Fernet(key)

# Message to encrypt
message = b"Hello, this is a secret message!"

# Encrypt the message
encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(message)

print("Encrypted message:", encrypted_message)

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message)

print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message.decode())
```

This script generates a random key, uses it to create a Fernet cipher, encrypts a message, then decrypts it. You can run this script and see the real-time encryption and decryption in action. Make sure to install the `cryptography` library if you haven't already (`pip install cryptography`).
